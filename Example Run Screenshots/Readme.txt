After the test program deneme.c is compiled and run (as a.out) we first get the screenshot Set-Nice-Inc-Working. When we do "dmesg -k" to see the kernel messages, we can observe the prints written in fork and exit. They show the nice and nice_inc values of the process and it's parents. In our screenshots, we can observe that process 1920 is the parent of 1921 and in fork function, the nice value is set based on the nice_inc of the parent. When the parent process (1920) is killed first, the child's (1921) nice value is updated according to the nice and nice_inc of it's real parent (system process).
